A collection of random generators for use with Mythic Bastionland by Chris McDowell.
## Tables
All of the spark tables from the book (p. 22) are included. I also added a collection of tables from Knave 2e by Ben Milton (Questing Beast) that felt like they might be useful in either game preparation or during a session.
## Running online games
I find this generator especially useful when I run online games of Mythic Bastionland. It lets me keep most of my play space clear of dice and books and tables, so when I need to roll something I can just switch to the generator tab.
